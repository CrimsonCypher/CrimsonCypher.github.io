        <h2 id="encryption-of-data">Encryption of data</h2>
        <p>I use VeraCrypt full disk encryption for all of my drives and partitions, not just my OS. VeraCrypt adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system and partitions encryption making it immune to new developments in attacks.
        VeraCrypt also solves many vulnerabilities and security issues found in TrueCrypt, the old industry standard for full disk encryption.</p>
        <p>Key disclosure law - Who is required to hand over the encryption keys to authorities?
        Mandatory key disclosure laws require individuals to turn over encryption keys to law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation. How these laws are implemented (who may be legally compelled to assist) vary from nation to nation, but a warrant is generally required. Defenses against key disclosure laws include steganography and encrypting data in a way that provides plausible deniability.</p>
        <p>Steganography involves hiding sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary data (for example, encrypting an image file and then hiding it in an audio file). With plausible deniability, data is encrypted in a way that prevents an adversary from being able to prove that the information they are after exists (for example, one password may decrypt benign data and another password, used on the same file, could decrypt sensitive data).</p>
        <h2 id="virtual-private-networks">Virtual Private Networks</h2>
        <p>I always recommend using a good VPN, even for normal every day browsing. View more information on how VPNs work and why using one is important here.
        View my other thread for my personal VPN suggestions. Or view this large spreadsheet that I put up on Google Docs (note that I did not compile this data, source is at the bottom of the spreadsheet).
        And here is a good guide on making VPNs more secure.</p>
        <p>Random Note: I strongly recommend using wired connections for your internet connection at home as opposed to wireless. There have been many cases of government snooping by them breaking into networks and collecting wireless data. A classic example is the arrest of Iserdo, the creator of the Butterfly Botnet (Mariposa). Ultimately his arrest and conviction was solidified when Law Enforcement broke into his Wireless Network and monitored him, gathering all the evidence necessary.</p>
        <h2 id="browser-choice-and-security">Browser Choice and Security</h2>
        <p>First things first, I will never recommend using Google Chrome and nothing any of you can say will change my mind on this.</p>
        <p>Firefox is fast, reliable, open source and respects your privacy.
        Tor Browser is your choice if you need an extra layer of anonymity. It&#39;s a modified version of Firefox, it comes with pre-installed privacy add-ons, encryption and an advanced proxy.</p>
        <p>Browser Fingerprint - Is your browser configuration unique?
        When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration, such as available fonts, browser type, and add-ons. If this combination of information is unique, it may be possible to identify and track you without using cookies. EFF created a Tool called Panopticlick to test your browser to see how unique it is.</p>
        <p>WebRTC IP Leak Test - Is your IP address leaking?
        WebRTC is a new communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN. While software like NoScript prevents this, it&#39;s probably a good idea to block this protocol directly as well, just to be safe.
        For Google Chrome users: There is no known working solution, only a plugin that is easily circumvented. Please use Firefox instead.
        For Firefox users: (Click to View)
        Test for WebRTC leaks here.</p>
        <h2 id="improve-your-security-with-these-firefox-add-ons">Improve your security with these Firefox add ons</h2>
        <p>Stop tracking with &quot;Disconnect&quot;
        Founded in 2011 by former Google engineers and a consumer-and privacy-rights attorney. The addon is open source and loads the pages you go to 27% faster and stops tracking by 2,000+ third-party sites. It also keeps your searches private.</p>
        <p>Block Ads with &quot;uBlock Origin&quot;
        An efficient wide-spectrum-blocker that&#39;s easy on memory, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there. It has no monetization strategy and is completely open source. We recommend FireFox but uBlock Origin also works in other browsers such as Safari, Opera, and Chromium. Unlike AdBlock Plus, uBlock does not allow so-called &quot;acceptable ads&quot;.</p>
        <p>Hinder Browser Fingerprinting with &quot;Random Agent Spoofer&quot;
        A privacy enhancing firefox addon which aims to hinder browser fingerprinting. It does this by changing the browser/device profile on a timer.</p>
        <p>Automatically Delete Cookies with &quot;Self-Destructing Cookies&quot;
        Automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged.</p>
        <p>Encryption with &quot;HTTPS Everywhere&quot;
        A Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure. A collaboration between The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
        <p>Block Content Delivery Networks with &quot;Decentraleyes&quot;
        Emulates Content Delivery Networks locally by intercepting requests, finding the required resource and injecting it into the environment. This all happens instantaneously, automatically, and no prior configuration is required. Source code: GitHub.</p>
        <p>Stop cross-site requests with uMatrix
        Many websites integrate features which let other websites track you, such as Facebook Like Buttons or Google Analytics. uMatrix gives you control over the requests that websites make to other websites. This gives you greater and more fine grained control over the information that you leak online.</p>
        <p>Be in total control with &quot;NoScript Security Suite&quot;
        Highly customizable plugin to selectively allow Javascript, Java, and Flash to run only on websites you trust. Not for casual users, it requires technical knowledge to configure.</p>
        <p>Content control with &quot;Policeman&quot;
        This addon has purpose similar to RequestPolicy and NoScript. It&#39;s different from the former in that it supports rules based on content type. For example, you can allow images and styles, but not scripts and frames for some sites. It can also be set up to act as a blacklist.</p>

        <h2 id="text-and-video-messaging">Text and Video Messaging</h2>
        <p>Secure your text messages, Instant Messaging and Chat</p>
        <p>Pidgin + OTR (Windows)
        Pidgin is a popular free and open source IM client that lets you chat to users on AIM, Google Talk, MSN, Yahoo and many more. OTR (Off-the-road) is a plugin that combines AES encryption, perfect forward secrecy, and the SHA-1 hash function to ensure strong encryption for IM sessions. As with GnuPG for emails, initial setup is a bit of a pain, but once done operation is seamless (we now have a detailed guide for this).</p>
        <p>Tox.im / Tox.chat is not a secure solution any longer. There is internal conflict between the devs, a break off with IP being stolen, and some devs claiming the NSA have been pushing bug fixes (open source) with exploits that allow them to monitor things. If anyone knows more about this, let me know. Information isn&#39;t very clear, but due to everything that has been happening, I would not trust my privacy with them.</p>
        <p>Adium (OSX)
