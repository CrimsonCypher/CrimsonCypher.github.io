        <ul>
            <li>Identifying critical information</li>
            <li>Analyzing threats</li>
            <li>Assessing vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Implementing countermeasures</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>OPSEC and Technology</strong></p>
        <p>With the rise of digital technology, OPSEC has become more challenging but also more crucial. It involves protecting information in digital formats, securing communications, and ensuring cybersecurity measures are in place.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
